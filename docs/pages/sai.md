## Installer

<p style="text-align: justify;"><tab1>Another important feature available in this application is a powerful installer which handles APK's, Split APK's, and app bundles. As the name itself suggests, this feature allows the installation of individual and split APK's (multiple APK's bearing the same package id and signature) as well as app bundles (<b>xapk</b>, <b>apkm</b>, and <b>apks</b> bundles). Since Google promotes the distribution of app bundles than normal APK's via their app store, and not many applications are available to handle the installation of such bundles, this feature will be a good deal for Package Manager users.</tab1></p>
